Cardano is a decentralized proof-of-stake layer 1 blockchain rooted in
rigorous research and academic principles. It emphasizes scalability,
sustainability, and interoperability, offering a secure platform for
decentralized applications, tokenized real-world assets, and community-
driven governance.
CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN NETWORK
Led by Charles Hoskinson,
responsible for Cardano’s
blockchain development and
technical architecture
An independent organization
focuses on global adoption,
strategic partnerships, and
regulatory efforts
The commercial arm, focused
on driving innovation,
investment, and business
adoption on Cardano.

BASHO VOLTAIRE
Cardano launched in
2017 as a federated
network using the
ground-breaking
Ouroboros
consensus protocol
In 2020, Cardano
introduced nodes run
by the community,
delegation & staking
ADA to participate in
the network

CARDANO IN DETAIL
Ouroboros tracks time in 5
day intervals (epochs) &
Cardano has run for 534
epochs without shutting down
Cardano max supply is 45 billion ADA 
No slashing
imposed on
SPOs or
delegators
58.1% of ADA is staked
(1 ADA = 1,000,000 “laces”)

AT THE
HEART OF
OUROBOROS
IS THE
CONCEPT OF
INFINITY
Higher delegation = higher chance to mint
DRMZ Stake Pool is one of 3000+ stake pools
that decentralize Cardano
SPOs that validate transactions & produce
blocks for the network receive rewards, which
are redistributed to delegators based on the
amount of ADA they have staked (APY ~ 4-6 %)
OUROBOROS / PROOF OF STAKE
Ouroboros randomly selects reliable SPOs as
“slot leaders” to produce blocks
Each block is cryptographically signed by its producer
(SPO) and linked to the previous block in the chain.

DRMZ deploys multiple nodes
across the planet with no less than
4 dedicated CPU cores, 24GB RAM
attached to High-Speed storage,
and employs a BP-Node, 3 Private
Relays, and 2 Public Relays.
BLOCKS & UPTIME
Block = Collections of transactions 
A stake pool’s uptime ensures it can participate in producing blocks.
 Higher uptime = better chances to produce blocks, which leads
to more rewards for delegators

1. Set up a Cardano wallet
DELEGATING ADA
2. Navigate to the delegation
section & search “DRMZ”.
3. Sign & Delegate your
ADA.
STAKING ADA
IS SIMPLE,
SAFE,  AND
REWARDING!

In governance, SPOs act as a technical check,
participating in decisions like protocol updates to
ensure they align with network stability and
performance.
The CC ensures that all governance actions
comply with the Constitution. They review and
approve protocol changes & treasury
withdrawals-- a safeguard for Cardano’s
principles of decentralization and transparency.
STAKE POOL OPERATORS (SPO)CARDANO GOVERNANCE
CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE (CC)
DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES (DREP)
DReps are ADA holders or groups empowered
to vote on governance proposals. They
represent themselves or the broader community
that delegates voting power to them.  
Governance Actions are submitted by ADA holders & voted
on by DREPs, SPOs, & the Constitutional Committee to be
ratified and enacted
In the era of Voltaire, Cardano's governance structure
distributes decision-making power across multiple
stakeholders:

The Interim Constitution provides a
temporary legal framework during the
transition to the Voltaire era.
GUARDRAILS (“INTERIM PERIOD”)
Proposal Mechanisms: Only key
governance bodies (DReps, SPOs, CC)
can submit proposals for governance
actions.
Review and Approval: The
Constitutional Committee reviews all
proposals to ensure they comply with
Cardano's principles.
Checks and Balances: Clear separation
of powers between the CC, DReps, and
SPOs to prevent centralization.
No-Confidence Vote: The community
can remove CC members through a no-
confidence vote if needed.
Transparency: All decisions and their
rationales are made public for community
scrutiny.
“By necessity, this Constitution recognizes the
role of and empowers the Constitutional
Committee, confirms the right of the Cardano
community to participate in collective bodies for
collaboration, gives effect to on-chain
governance, and empowers DReps to act as
the voice ofada owners for on-chain voting.
The Constitution also recognizes the necessity of
safeguarding access to and the use of funds of
the Cardano treasury through the inclusion of the
Cardano Guardrails in this Constitution”
THE PREAMBLE:
INTERIM CONSTITUTION

STAKE POOL OPERATORS (SPOS)
In the Age of Voltaire, your ADA continues to
help secure Cardano by supporting stake pool
operations & empowers DReps to vote on
governance proposals
Maintain network security through
maintenance (software updates) and reliable
block production.
1.
Inform delegators about proposals and
voting options.
2.
Collaborate with the community to advance
governance goals.
3.
CHANGES TO ADA REWARDS SPO RESPONSIBILITIES
Rewards continue to be earned as usual
from your SPO, but withdrawing them
requires interaction with governance:
Delegate to a DRep 
Abstain
SPOS ENSURE
THE STABILITY
OF CARDANO

DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES (DREPS)
Anyone holding ADA can become a DRep
and their “voting power” is directly proportional to
the amount of ADA delegated to them,
incentivizing alignment with ADA holder’s values. 
Register as a DRep through the
governance portal.
1.
Lock 500 ADA to confirm your participation.
(refundable upon retiring)
2.
Share your vision and values with the
community to gain delegations from ADA
holders.
3.
At the heart of
Cardano governance
is community
empowerment
Review and vote on governance proposals,
ensuring that they align with the best interests of
the community & network.
1.
Stay informed about governance developments,
proposals, and updates.
2.
Engage with the community to understand their
perspectives and needs.
3.

TWO GOVERNANCE STATES :
The current Interim Constitutional
Committee (ICC) will serve for a two-year term
CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE (CC)
The CC safeguards
Cardano’s
governance,
ensuring
constitutionality in
every action
An elected branch of Cardano’s on-chain
governance that votes on the constitutionality of
governance actions, ensuring they comply with
the Cardano Constitution. 
7 GOVERNANCE ACTIONS
Confident: The community has confidence in the committee members,
allowing them to continue overseeing governance actions without challenge.
Not Confident: “No confidence” is triggered due to the community’s loss of
trust in one or more members, leading to possible removal or relection.

CARDANO IS A
FRAMEWORK FOR
MAKING DREAMS
COME TRUE
- Charles Hoskinson

Wallets are the gateway to
decentralized finance (DeFi) and
NFTs. 
They allow you to securely store your
tokens and interact with DApps directly
from your browser.

Regardless of the wallet you
choose, secure & protect your
private keys (secret words)
above all else!

Each Cardano wallet comes with: 
A payment address & staking
address 
Payment address - used for 
receiving payment/ADA 
Staking address - used for
delegating to stake pools and
receiving staking rewards
CARDANO ADDRESSES
Wallets can have multiple
payment addresses but
only one staking address

YOU CAN VIEW BLOCKS, EPOCHS, SLOTS, AND TRANSACTIONS ON CARDANOSCAN

In the UTXO model transactions
have inputs and outputs, where the
inputs are unspent outputs from
previous transactions. 
Wallet balances =  the sum of
several UTXOs associated with
that address.
In the account model, each user has
a balance associated with their
account. Transactions transfer funds
from one account to another, and the
balances are updated accordingly.
Cardano’s EUTXO works this way, but allows smart
contracts to be built directly into transactions
UTXO VS ACCOUNT MODEL
UTXO benefits: you can send multiple assets to
different addresses in one transaction.

2 inputs from the same
wallet used to pay 56 ADA
to one of the output
addresses:
50 + 34 = 84 ADA input
2 outputs for 2 different
wallets:
84 - 56 = 28 ADA left 
on one of the utxos 
UTXO EXAMPLES

Unique digital assets on a blockchain; there is only one of
that asset on the blockchain 
NFTs are used to represent ownership of a digital
asset (images, videos, audio, pdfs, etc)
NFTs are like Pokemon cards that you can’t fake. If the
policy for a NFT is correct, it is guaranteed to be real
NFT (Non-Fungible Token) 
FT (Fungible Token) 
Non-unique digital assets. There are multiples of the same
token and you can use them interchangeably (Bitcoin,
ADA, memecoins)
NFTS ON CARDANO

Cardano native tokens do not require
a smart contract or extra tooling to
support them on the blockchain
This is helpful for security and for
staking. NFTs and other tokens are
“baked in” to how Cardano works
All NFTs have a policy which governs
which wallet(s) can edit the token &
metadata (the image, attributes, etc)
If a policy is “locked” then it can no
longer edit, mint (create), or burn
(destroy) NFTs

BROWSERS
Pool.pm is a site for viewing your
wallet, NFTs/tokens, and managing
staking/delegation. 
It’s an easy way to view your
assets from any web browser.
Just go to:
pool.pm/your-address
or
pool.pm/your-ada-handle

STAKING NFTS
For various NFT projects,
you can stake your NFTs for
additional rewards.
Staking mechanisms can
work different from project to
project.
The NFTs are locked in a
smart contract but remain in
your wallet. The assets
cannot be spent while they
are locked/staked.

TAPTOOLS 
Analytics, charting, & trading
in one app. If you own a
Tappy (NFT) you get pro
features like a wallet profiler
so you can see top traders
and who is selling on you.

METADATA
Onchain metadata is how you link data like traits or
media (image, video, music, etc) to an NFT or token
There are 2 standards for Cardano NFT metadata: CIP-25
and CIP-68. CIP-25 is the original way to mint NFTs, which
existed before smart contracts. CIP-68 extended the
standard so metadata could be read by smart contracts.
LUCID JS EXAMPLES

ON-CHAIN METADATA
Most NFTs rely on the IPFS
(InterPlanetary File System) to
store large files like images or
videos. 
Cardano does support fully on-
chain metadata if you convert your
image/media/html to base64 and
are under the maximum size
requirements for a transaction
(16kb)
