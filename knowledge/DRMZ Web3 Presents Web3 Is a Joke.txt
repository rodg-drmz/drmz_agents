for the internet that’s all about
decentralization and using innovative
technologies like AI, blockchains,
cryptocurrencies, robotics, and
Internet of Things (IoT).

Blockchains are like digital ledgers that record transactions
across a decentralized network. They ensure transparency,
security, and immutability. 
Cardano, the third generation of cryptocurrencies,
emphasizes scalability, sustainability, and interoperability.
Rooted in rigorous research and academic principles, it
offers a secure platform for decentralized applications and
real-world asset tokenization.

BITCOIN & ETHEREUM
Bitcoin was the first generation of cryptocurrencies, introducing
decentralized digital currency, while Ethereum, the second
generation, expanded blockchain technology to support smart
contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

Wallets are the gateway to decentralized finance (DeFi)
and NFTs. They allow you to securely store your tokens
and interact with DApps directly from your browser.

above all else!
Vespr is a popular mobile option for interacting with the
Cardano blockchain. Metamask and Phantom are
popular options for interacting with Ethereum & Solana
blockchains.

CARDANO STAKE POOLS
At the heart of
Ouroboros is the
concept of infinity
Ouroboros, Cardano's Proof of stake consensus mechanism is  
approximately 10,000 times more energy-efficient than Bitcoin’s
Proof of work. 
Slot leaders are selected to mint blocks based on their “stake” in
the network.
Stake pools that produce blocks receive rewards and these are
redistributed to delegators. 3000+ SPOs decentralize Cardano.
Set up a Cardano wallet of
your choice.
1.
Navigate to the delegation
section & search for "DRMZ"
2.
Sign & Delegate your ADA.3.
"STAKING ADA IS
SIMPLE AND
REWARDING!
Your ADA is now working for
you, contributing to the
decentralization and security
of the Cardano blockchain

UTXO vs. Accounts Model 
REAL-WORLD
ASSETS ARE BEING
“TOKENIZED”
NFTS & DEFI
NFTs are like digital collector's items, unique and
irreplaceable.
On Cardano, creators can tokenize their art, music, or
other digital assets as NFTs, proving ownership and
authenticity on the blockchain.
CARDANO
Cardano, like Bitcoin, operates on
the UTXO (Unspent Transaction
Output) model to process and
validate transactions
Ethereum, like while many other
popular blockchains, including
prefer the Accounting model for
professing & validating
FUNGIBLE =
INTERCHANGEABLE
DeFi brings traditional financial services to the
blockchain, making them more accessible and efficient.
Cardano's DeFi ecosystem includes lending,
borrowing, trading, and more, all without
intermediaries.
NFTS ARE “NATIVE
TOKENS” ON
CARDANO
TOKEN GATING
Web3 token gating offers various benefits,
including incentivizing token ownership,
fostering community engagement, and
monetizing digital content or services.
